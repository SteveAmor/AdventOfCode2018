Advent of code 2018

My Python code to solve Advent of Code 2018 challanges.  

Although I'm not writing unit tests, I'm trying to structure the code based on the single responsibility principle.  

My code is hopefully 'clean' and 'readable' with 'meaningful' names.  Hopefully PEP8 compliant (or as close as I can get).  

Of course, it's a race to get the answers which results in code which doesn't necessarily comply with the above.  Just like a developer under the pressure of a deadline.
